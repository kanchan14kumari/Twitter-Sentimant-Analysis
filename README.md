# Sentiment Analysis of Twitter

This project involves training a machine learning model to make predictions based on a dataset fetched from Kaggle. Below are the steps followed in this project:

## Steps Followed

1. **Fetching the Dataset**
   - The dataset was fetched from Kaggle using the Kaggle API.

2. **Importing Libraries**
   - Essential libraries for data manipulation, preprocessing, and modeling were imported.

3. **Data Preprocessing**
   - **Stemming**: Performed stemming to reduce words to their root form.
   - **Managing Missing Data**: Handled any missing data appropriately.

4. **Splitting the Data**
   - The dataset was split into training and testing sets.

5. **Converting Textual Data**
   - Converted textual data to numerical data using appropriate techniques.

6. **Training the Model**
   - Trained a machine learning model using Logistic Regression.

7. **Model Evaluation**
   - Evaluated the model using accuracy score.
   - **Accuracy on Test Data**: 77.8%

8. **Saving the Trained Model**
   - Saved the trained model for future use.

9. **Future Predictions**
   - Used the saved model to make future predictions.
